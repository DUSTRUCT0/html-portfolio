<h1>Perfectly Acceptable Movies That I Might Recommend</h1>
<h2>A rumination by Dustin Brown</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse</h3>
<p>Holy cow this movie is pretty. I watched it with my wife at the theater, and we both were gushing about it afterwards. This is a film where it's exceedingly clear That
    the people who worked on it were exceedingly passionate about their craft and the story they wanted to tell. And the inclusivity represented by the cast and characters on screen 
    was incredible!
</p>
<h3>Dune: Part 2</h3>
<p>When I watched Dune: Part 1, I came out of the theaters saying "If Denis had made a 6-hour-long movie that covered all of the events of the book, I 100% would have stayed to watch 
    it all." I still stand by that statement. This film shouldn't be held up against the book to compare for accuracy; it stands on its own merits, as its own piece of media.

<h3>Entergalactic</h3>
<p>A great animated film that's also very pretty and pushes some of the boundaries of the medium that audiences are used to today. Would highly recommend.</p>
